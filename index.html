<p> I dont know what else to write. But since you are an expert, i dont see any need to tell you more. You should do something very nice as like professionals do. Nothing else is coming to my mind. But i would like something dark. But before you make it, talk to me about it.</p>
<p>-Thanks,
Wicked</p>
